How it works: Uses pygame to create a picture then saves it and sets it as the computer background. Uses pynput, pygame and ctypes libraries.

At the top of live_background.py you will need to change: dip_size to your computers resolution, pic folder to a complete path where a picture can be stored to show as bg(could be literally anywhere), choose walpaper mode 1,2,3 or 4.
